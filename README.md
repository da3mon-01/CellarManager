# CellarManager

My University Thesis I made 4 years ago, that is manages (most) necessary data for a wine cellar. 
I used Spring Framework, Vaadin to build the application, and its intented to be hosted on MongoDB.
As it was a thesis work, its mostly unfinished, I do not recommend it to be actually used :)
